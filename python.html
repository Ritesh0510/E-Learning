        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.
            python-programming-language Python-Tutorial
            This specially designed Python tutorial will help you learn Python Programming Language in most efficient way, with the topics from basics to advanced (like Web-scraping, Django, Deep-Learning, etc.)<br>
            <h4 class="FF">Python 3 basics</h4><br>
           <ul><li>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990s and its latest version is 3.7.1, we can simply call it as Python3. Python 3.0 was released in 2008. and is interpreted language i.e it’s not compiled and the interpreter will check the code line by line.</li><br> This article can used to learn very basics of Python programming language.
<li> let’s do the most popular ‘HelloWorld’ tradition and hence compare Python’s Syntax with C, C++, Java ( I have taken these 3 because they are most famous and mostly used languages).</li><br>
<li> Python code for "Hello World"</li><br>
<li>nothing else to type...see how simple is the syntax.</li><br></ul>

print("Hello World")<br>      
Note: Please note that Python for its scope doesn’t depend on the braces ( { } ), instead it uses indentation for its scope.<br>
Now moving on further Lets start our basics of Python . I will be covering the basics in some small sections. Just go through them and trust me you’ll learn the basics of Python very easily.
Introduction and Setup<br>
If you are on Windows OS download Python by Clicking here and now install from the setup and in the start menu type IDLE.IDLE, you can think it as an Python’s IDE to run the Python Scripts.
It will look somehow this :<br>


If you are on Linux/Unix-like just open the terminal and on 99% linux OS Python comes preinstalled with the OS.Just type ‘python3’ in terminal and you are ready to go.
It will look like this :<br>

The ” >>> ” represents the python shell and its ready to take python commands and code.<br>

Variables and Data Structures<br>

In other programming languages like C, C++, and Java, you will need to declare the type of variables but in Python you don’t need to do that. Just type in the variable and when values will be given to it, then it will automatically know whether the value given would be an int, float, or char or even a String.<br>
# Python program to declare variables<br>
myNumber = 3<br>
print(myNumber)<br>

myNumber2 = 4.5<br>
print(myNumber2)<br>

myNumber ="helloworld<br>"
print(myNumber)<br>
Output:<br>

3<br>
4.5<br>
helloworld<br>
See, how simple is it, just create a variable and assign it any value you want and then use the print function to print it. Python have 4 types of built in Data Structures namely List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.<br>

List is the most basic Data Structure in python. List is a mutable data structure i.e items can be added to list later after the list creation. It’s like you are going to shop at the local market and made a list of some items and later on you can add more and more items to the list.
append() function is used to add data to the list.<br>


# Python program to illustrate a list <br>

# creates a empty list<br>
nums = [] <br>

# appending data in list<br>
nums.append(21)<br>
nums.append(40.5)<br>
nums.append("String")<br>

print(nums)<br>
Output:<br>

[21, 40.5, String]<br>
