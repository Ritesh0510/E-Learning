<h4 class="FF">HTML basics</h4>
In this article, we will go through all the basic stuff of HTML coding. There are various tags that we must consider and include while starting to code in HTML. These tags help in the organization and basic formatting of elements in our script or web pages.<br> These step by step procedures will guide you through the process of writing HTML.<br>
Basic HTML Document: Below mentioned are the basic HTML tags which divide the whole document into various parts like head, body etc.<br>
Every HTML document begins with a HTML document tag. Although this is not mandatory but it is a good convention to start the document with this below-mentioned tag.<br> Please refer to the HTML Doctypes article for more information related to Doctypes.<br>
<!DOCTYPE html><br><ul>
<li>html : Every HTML code must be enclosed between basic HTML tags. It begins with html and ends with /html tag.</li><br>
<li>head: The head tag comes next which contains all the header information of the web page or documents like the title of the page and other miscellaneous information. This information is enclosed within the head tag which opens with head and ends with /head. The contents will of this tag will be explained in the later sections of course.</li><br>
<li>title: We can mention the title of a web page using the title tag. This is header information and hence is mentioned within the header tags. The tag begins with title and ends with /title.</li><br>
<li>body: Next step is the most important of all the tags we have learned so far. The body tag contains the actual body of the page which will be visible to all the users. This opens with body and ends with /body. Every content enclosed within this tag will be shown on the web page be it writings or images or audios or videos or even links. We will see later in the section how using various tags we may insert mentioned contents into our web pages</li><br></ul>
